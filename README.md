# Bankist app

This is an app that simulates the behavior of a user interface in which you can check your balance, make transactions and lend money among other things. The user interface is really intuitive so the usability details are left to your curiosity :joy:

## Logging of users.

To login users you can test with these four values:

* user: js, pin: 1111
* user: jd, pin: 2222
* user: stw, pin: 3333
* user: ss, pin: 4444

## things you can do
+ Watch movements.
+ Transfer money.
+ Borrow from the bank.
+ Arrange the movements in different order.
